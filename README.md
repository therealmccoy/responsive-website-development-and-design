##  Responsive Website Development and Design Specialization.

by University of London & Goldsmiths, University of London ##

These are my notes/ assignment work and code from the above mentioned specialisation course.

This course teaches the fundamentals of full stack web development in five comprehensive courses.

From the Course Website itself: 

"This Specialization covers the basics of modern full stack web development, from UX design, to front-end coding, to custom databases. You’ll build foundational skills in a full range of technologies, including HTML/CSS, Javascript, and MongoDB, and you’ll learn to implement a reactive, multi-user web application using the meteor.js framework. We’ll also touch on more advanced topics, such as APIs, data visualization, and animation. Upon completing the Specialization and Capstone Project, you’ll have designed and launched your own fully-functioning, responsive web application."
